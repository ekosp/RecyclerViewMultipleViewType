Implement heterogeneous layouts inside a RecyclerView.

RecyclerView with heterogeneous layouts is commonly used in to display section headers and details(Both require different layouts, hence different view type). Also itâ€™s used in a Newsfeed Application(like Facebook, Instagram) that display essentially different views for different types. Example : text, image, gif, video etc. Each of these require a different layout type inside the RecyclerView.
